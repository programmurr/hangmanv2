- Pseudocode complete
- Successfully generating a word between 5 and 12 characters from the string file and transforming it into a blank string in the test code
- Nothing committed to main file yet
- Tomorrow will continue on piecing together bits from the pseudocode in the test code file

Okay so I'll be taking my time with this one. I will be making this alongside reading and learning from Practical Object-Oriented Design by Sandi Metz, and applying concepts I learn along the way.

Of course I'll not be as good as the examples in the book in terms of avoiding dependency, but I can set myself these 3 rules to follow:

- Ensure methods only have 1 purpose
- Ensure classes only have 1 purpose
- Ensure no method is more than 10 lines long

If I can abide by those 3 rules and successfully implement concepts from POODR along the way, it's a success and a step forward in my programming

Fleshed out the UI today. Will read more POODR and implement where I can.

I haven't been doing nothing!

I've been reading POODR and implementing lessons learned from that to the test code as well as I can for now, and I've been looking up how to make UMLs.

The test code is coming along nicely. So far no methods longer than 10 lines, I have established an implied game loop through the use of methods calling each other appropriately, when the user presses a key it instantly responds instead of having to 'enter' via the use of require 'io/console'. Small steps forward, both in learning techniques and writing cleaner code.

When the game is playable without the save/load functions, I'll call that version one. I'll have the connections and wiring in place though, so if someone chooses a save or load screen I will say it is 'under construction' and give them the option to quit or go back to the game screen for now.

One 'must do' when this is finished is to compare the code to my highlighted notes in POODR.
