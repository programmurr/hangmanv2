Okay so I'll be taking my time with this one. I will be making this alongside reading and learning from Practical Object-Oriented Design by Sandi Metz, and applying concepts I learn along the way.

Of course I'll not be as good as the examples in the book in terms of avoiding dependency, but I can set myself these 3 rules to follow:

- Ensure methods only have 1 purpose
- Ensure classes only have 1 purpose
- Ensure no method is more than 10 lines long

If I can abide by those 3 rules and successfully implement concepts from POODR along the way, it's a success and a step forward in my programming

Fleshed out the UI today. Will read more POODR and implement where I can.
